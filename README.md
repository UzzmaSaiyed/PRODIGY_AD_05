QR Code Scanner App

This is a basic QR code scanner application for Android, developed using Java. The app allows users to scan QR codes, display the scanned contents, and open any links contained within the codes.

App Features

QR Code Scanning: 

The app leverages a QR code scanning library to decode QR codes in real-time using the device's camera.

Display Scanned Contents: 

After scanning, the app displays the decoded content, whether it's plain text, URLs, or other types of data.

Open Links:

If the scanned QR code contains a URL, the app can open the link directly in the device's web browser.

Benefits of Java and Android

Java:

The app benefits from Java’s robustness and extensive libraries, which facilitate efficient development and reliable performance. Java’s object-oriented approach helps maintain clean and modular code, making it easier to manage and extend.

Android: 

Using the Android platform, the app takes advantage of its powerful camera APIs and seamless integration with system services. This ensures that the QR code scanning is smooth and responsive across a variety of devices. Android’s wide range of tools and frameworks also simplifies the process of building and deploying the app, allowing it to deliver a consistent user experience.

This QR code scanner app is an excellent example of how Java and Android can be utilized to create practical and user-friendly mobile applications with real-time data processing capabilities.
